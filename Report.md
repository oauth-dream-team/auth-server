### Ratings and Reviews
#### Documentation
Github oauth is for a very niche market of users. Github is mostly used by developers so the integration of  oauth strategy will only serve a developer clientele. Which in most cases may not be scalable because most developers are pretty conscious about granting access to their personal data.

#### Systems Requirements
There is no heroku site, just using nodemon to get everything up and running.

#### Ramp-Up Projections
The integration process for a team of developers to configure and test the oauth capabilities should take a team of mid-level developers about a week.

#### Community Support and Adoption levels
This is an extrememly popular method/strategy for authorization as the authetication process allows you to save space and to use personal data from another platform, in this case GitHub.
Sites that currently uses github oauth is Netlify and Heroku, which are primarily developer platforms.
